# ESK8 : an electric skateboard project

This repo gathers files I have been using for my electric skateboard.

There are 3 folders.
* 3D parts contains **.stl** and **.CATPart** files. You can edit the CATPart using Catia V5 or directly print the parts using the associated .stl files.
* e-sk8 V2 contains files for an Xcode application to be run on an iPhone. This was developped for iOS 10 but you can easily update it. *Note that you won't find any version of this application on the App Store as it requires buying an Apple Developper License.*
* skate is a basic folder containing a single **.ino** file. This file is to be run on an arduino and makes the link between a HM-10 Bluetooth module and the iOS application.
